### Reflection
- **S ‚Äì I was on a blank CV, and the challenge was having to gather all the information.

## Business Communication

### Evidence

### Reflection
- **S ‚Äì** At the start of the module I often used casual or ambiguous language in professional messages. Emails and meeting contributions sometimes came across as unstructured, and I didn‚Äôt always tailor tone to the audience. This created confusion and lowered the perceived professionalism of my communication. I personal had no idea how to start a email when it came to greetings or how to use honorific appropriately
- **T ‚Äì** My goal was to learn to choose an appropriate tone (formal vs informal), write concise professional emails, and present information clearly in virtual and face-to-face settings. I wanted to communicate with authority without sounding robotic.  
- **A ‚Äì** I completed the *Business Communication* lessons from the Work Readiness module. I studied email structure (subject line ‚Üí greeting ‚Üí body ‚Üí closing), practiced converting informal messages into formal versions, and followed style guidelines: correct grammar, no slang, appropriate sign-offs, and succinct subject lines. I also rehearsed speaking points for meetings and practiced neutral, professional language for difficult messages (e.g., delivering constructive feedback).  
- **R ‚Äì** I now write emails that are concise, correctly formatted, and tailored to the recipient. In group work and presentations I use clearer phrasing and proper structure, which reduced misunderstandings and led to smoother collaboration. My improved communication increased the clarity of task assignments and strengthened my professional presence.

## Interview Skills

### Evidence

### Reflection
- **S ‚Äì** Interviews used to trigger anxiety ‚Äî I knew my technical stuff but struggled to frame examples, especially behaviour-based answers. I frequently rambled or missed the outcome part, so my answers lacked impact.  
- **T ‚Äì** My objective was to learn how to prepare for interviews effectively: craft concise examples using the STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result) technique, refine my introduction, and practise professional appearance and tone.  
- **A ‚Äì** I followed the Interview Skills lessons: identified common technical and behavioural questions, wrote STAR responses for my top 8 scenarios (team conflict, deadline pressure, technical challenge, leadership), and rehearsed them aloud. I also practiced a 60-second elevator pitch summarising my skills and projects, and I recorded mock answers to self-review for pacing and clarity.  
- **R ‚Äì** I now deliver structured, outcome-focused responses that highlight measurable results. My confidence has improved; I handle behavioural questions with minimal filler and stronger emphasis on impact. Interviewers get a clear sense of my problem-solving approach and contribution.

### Reflection
- **S ‚Äì** The idea of a live mock interview felt intimidating, I worried about performance under pressure and how to translate rehearsed answers into authentic conversation. I also lacked feedback on non-verbal cues.  
- **T ‚Äì** My goal was to simulate a real interview environment to evaluate my communication, body language, and ability to answer technical and behavioural questions under time pressure. I wanted actionable feedback.  
- **A ‚Äì** I participated in a timed mock interview that included behavioural and technical rounds. I focused on posture, eye contact, calm breathing, and concise STAR answers. After the session, I collected feedback from the interviewer on clarity, relevance of examples, and tone. I iterated on my answers and practiced follow-up questions to sound more conversational.  
- **R ‚Äì** The mock interview reduced my anxiety and exposed subtle habits (e.g., filler words, rushed conclusions). With feedback, I refined my STAR examples to include clearer metrics and lessons learned. My overall interview presence is more balanced, prepared but natural, and I can pivot from technical detail to high-level impact when needed.

## Professional Networking

### Evidence

### Reflection
- **S ‚Äì** I had minimal networking experience and no consistent professional brand online. I wasn‚Äôt sure how to approach industry professionals or present projects credibly on platforms like LinkedIn.  
- **T ‚Äì** My goal was to build a professional online presence, learn how to reach out to contacts, and understand networking etiquette (personalised messages, follow-ups, value first connections).  
- **A ‚Äì** I completed the Professional Networking lessons, created/updated my LinkedIn profile to include project highlights and clear role descriptions, and wrote a personalised connection message template. I joined relevant groups, followed industry leaders, and engaged with content (comments + shares) weekly to demonstrate thoughtful interest. I also practised informational interview scripts to request short chats with professionals.  
- **R ‚Äì** I now have a LinkedIn profile that reflects my technical skills and projects. I‚Äôve connected with peers and a few industry contacts, and I understand how to nurture relationships through targeted, value-based outreach. Networking now feels like a strategic growth channel rather than a chore.

### Reflection
- **S ‚Äì** Entering the workplace with no prior experience made it unclear which behaviours were expected in professional contexts, from punctuality to corporate communication norms. I wanted to avoid awkward first impressions.  
- **T ‚Äì** My objective was to understand workplace expectations: appropriate dress/appearance, punctuality, respectful communication, confidentiality, contribution to team culture, and conflict resolution techniques.  
- **A ‚Äì** I studied the Workplace Etiquette lessons, participated actively in group projects to practice professional behaviour, and requested feedback from teammates about communication style and reliability. I also prepared a short personal checklist for professional conduct (e.g., meeting prep, read-before-meeting, timely responses, documenting decisions via email).  
- **R ‚Äì** I now consistently meet workplace expectations: I arrive prepared and on time, communicate respectfully and clearly, maintain confidentiality where required, and proactively document agreed actions. These behaviours improved team trust and made collaborative work more efficient.
